# /etc/touch-timeout.conf
# Configuration file for touch-timeout service
#
# All values are optional - program uses defaults if not specified
# Command-line arguments override these settings

# Display brightness when active (15-255)
# Recommended ≤200 for RPi official 7" touchscreen (verified max brightness/current)
# Default: 100
brightness=160

# Seconds of inactivity before turning off display
# Must be ≥10 seconds
# Default: 300 (5 minutes)
off_timeout=300

# Percentage of off_timeout when dimming occurs (10-100%)
# 50 = dim at halfway point (e.g., 150s if off_timeout=300s)
# 100 = no dimming (dims at same instant as off)
# Default: 50
dim_percent=20

# Backlight device name (found in /sys/class/backlight/)
# Common values: rpi_backlight, 10-0045
# Default: rpi_backlight
backlight=rpi_backlight

# Input device name (found in /dev/input/)
# Common values: event0, event1, event2
# Use 'ls -l /dev/input/by-path/' to identify touchscreen
# Default: event0
device=event0

# Polling interval in milliseconds (10-2000)
# Lower = more responsive but higher CPU usage
# Recommended range: 50-1000ms
# 50ms  = ~0.15% CPU (very responsive)
# 100ms = ~0.08% CPU (balanced - recommended)
# 200ms = ~0.04% CPU (efficient)
# Default: 100
poll_interval=100

# FOR v1.0.1 AND LATER ONLY:
# Logging verbosity (0-2)
# 0 = none (silent production mode, no SD writes)
# 1 = info (startup, state changes, warnings, errors)
# 2 = debug (all events including touch/timeout checks)
# Note: Command-line -d flag overrides this setting at runtime
# Default: 0
#log_level=0 # Uncomment to set log level
